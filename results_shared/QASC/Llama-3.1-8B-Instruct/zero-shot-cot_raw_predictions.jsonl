Considering the options, heat is the correct answer as it increases with altitude in the stratosphere.\", \"ANSWER\":\"E\"}", "3": "{\" EXPLANATION\":\"As altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases, allowing for less moisture to be held in the air. However, the air itself is drier, but the air can hold more water vapor. This is because the molecules are farther apart at higher altitudes, allowing for more water vapor to exist in the air. This is a key factor in the formation of clouds and precipitation. Additionally, the temperature decreases with altitude, which also affects the amount of water vapor that can exist in the air. Therefore, the correct answer is the one that is related to water vapor.\",\n \" ANSWER\":\"G\"}", "4": "{\"Explanation\": \"At higher altitudes, atmospheric pressure decreases, allowing air to expand and cool. This cooling effect increases the likelihood of water vapor condensing into clouds and precipitation, thus increasing water vapor. Additionally, the decrease in atmospheric pressure can cause the body to lose heat more quickly, potentially increasing the risk of fever.
