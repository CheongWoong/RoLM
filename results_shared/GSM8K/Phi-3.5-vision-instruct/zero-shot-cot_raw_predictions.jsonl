Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, with Camden painting 12 more than Sarah. So, if we let y be the number of eggs Sarah painted, then Camden painted y + 12. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56, so x + x + y + (y + 12) = 56. Simplifying this equation gives us 2x + 2y + 12 = 56, which further simplifies to x + y + 6 = 28. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, we can set up the equation x + x = 28 - 6, which simplifies to 2x = 22, and therefore x = 11. Substituting x back into the equation for Camden and Sarah, we get 11 + y + (y + 12) = 56, which simplifies to 2y + 23 = 56, and therefore 2y = 33, and y = 16.5.

According to the problem, b = 5s - 4. The total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is 116. Therefore, s + b = 116. Substituting the expression for b into the second equation gives s + (5s - 4) = 116. Simplifying this equation results in 6s - 4 = 116. Adding 4 to both sides gives 6s = 120. Dividing both sides by 6 gives s = 20. Substituting s back into the expression for b gives b = 5(20) - 4, which simplifies to b = 100.
