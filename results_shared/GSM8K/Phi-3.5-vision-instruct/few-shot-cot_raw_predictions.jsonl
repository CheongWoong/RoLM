Substituting the values of B and Q from the equations, we get W + 2Q + Q = 700, which simplifies to W + 3Q = 700. Since W = 2B and B = 2Q, we can substitute B with 2Q in the equation, giving us W + 3Q = 700. Now, we know that W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q. Substituting W with 4Q in the equation, we get 4Q + 3Q = 700, which simplifies to 7Q = 700. Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100. Since B = 2Q, B = 2*100 = 200. And since W = 2B, W = 2*200 = 400. Therefore, there are 400 worker bees.\", \" ANSWER\": \"400\"}```"}}

{"id": 866, "raw_predictions": {"0": "```json {\"Explanation\":\"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F. According to the problem, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has F - 12 books. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has (F - 12) + 25 books. The total number of books they have together is F + (F - 12) + ((F - 12) + 25) = 85. Simplifying this equation gives us 3F - 12 + 25 = 85, which simplifies further to 3F + 13 = 85. Subtracting 13 from both sides gives us 3F = 72, and dividing both sides by 3 gives us F = 24.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, A = M.\nThe total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is 2A.\nCamden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as S. Therefore, Camden painted S + 12 eggs.\nThe total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah is S + (S + 12) = 30.\nCombining the terms, we get 2S + 12 = 30.\nSubtracting 12 from both sides, we get 2S = 18.\nDividing both sides by 2, we get S = 9.\nSo, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.\nThe difference in the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold is 21 - A.\nSince A = M, we have 21 - M.\nWe know that 2A + M = 56, and since A = M, we can write this as 2A + A = 56, which simplifies to 3A = 56.\nDividing both sides by 3, we get A = 56/3 \u2248 18.67.\nSince we can't have a fraction of an egg, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 18.\nSo, Arnold painted 18 eggs, and the difference is 21 - 18 = 3.\nTherefore, Camden painted 3 more eggs than Arnold.\", \" ANSWER\":\"3\"}```", "4": "```json {\"Explanation\": \"Arnold and Madeline together painted 56/2=<<56/2=28>>28 eggs.\nCamden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs.\nCamden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so if we let the number of eggs Sarah painted be x, then Camden painted x+12 eggs.\nSo, x + (x+12) = 30, which simplifies to 2x + 12 = 30.\nSolving for x gives us x = 14, so Sarah painted 14 eggs and Camden painted 14+12=<<14+12=26>>26 eggs.\nTherefore, Camden painted 26 - 28 = <<26-28=-2>>-2 more eggs than Arnold.\", \"Answer\": \"-2\"}```", "5": "```json {\" Explanation\": \"Arnold and Madeline together painted 56/2=<<56/2=28>>28 eggs.\nCamden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs.\nCamden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so if we let x be the number of eggs Sarah painted, then Camden painted x+12 eggs.\nSo, x + (x+12) = 30\n2x + 12 = 30\n2x = 18\nx = 9\nSo, Sarah painted 9 eggs and Camden painted 9+12=<<9+12=21>>21 eggs.\nTherefore, Camden painted 21 - 28 = <<21-28=-7>>-7 more eggs than Arnold.\", \" Answer\": \"-7\"}```", "6": "```json {\"EXPLANATION\": \"Arnold and Madeline together painted 56/2=<<56/2=28>>28 eggs.\nCamden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs.\nCamden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so if we let the number of eggs Sarah painted be x, then Camden painted x+12 eggs.\nSo, x + (x+12) = 30, which simplifies to 2x + 12 = 30.\nSolving for x gives us x = 14, so Sarah painted 14 eggs and Camden painted 14+12=<<14+12=26>>26 eggs.\nTherefore, Camden painted 26 - 28 = <<26-28=-2>>-2 more eggs than Arnold.\", \"ANSWER\": \"-2\"}```", "7": "```json {\" EXPLANATION\": \"Arnold and Madeline together painted 56/2=<<56/2=28>>28 eggs.\nCamden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs.\nCamden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so if we let the number of eggs Sarah painted be x, then Camden painted x+12 eggs.\nSo, x + (x+12) = 30, which simplifies to 2x + 12 = 30.\nSolving for x gives us x = 14, so Sarah painted 14 eggs and Camden painted 14+12=<<14+12=26>>26 eggs.\nTherefore, Camden painted 26 - 28 = <<26-28=-2>>-2 more eggs than Arnold.\", \" ANSWER\": \"-2\"}```"}}

The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so there were F - 14 - (14/2) = F - 14 - 7 = F - 21 fries left. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so there were F - 21 - (3*3) = F - 21 - 9 = F - 30 fries left. A raccoon took two thirds of the remaining fries, so there were F - 30 - (2/3)*(F - 30) = F - 30 - (2/3)*F + 20 = (1 - 2/3)*F + 20 = (1/3)*F + 20 fries left. Finally, an ant took one fry, leaving 5 fries. So, (1/3)*F + 20 - 1 = 5, which simplifies to (1/3)*F = 4. Therefore, F = 4 * 3 = <<4*3=12>>12.\", \" ANSWER\": \"12\"}```"}}
