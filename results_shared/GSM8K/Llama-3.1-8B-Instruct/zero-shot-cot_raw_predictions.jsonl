Since Elise sold twice as many books in the first year, she sold 2x books in the first year. The total number of books sold in the first two years is 3x. Since there are 50 unsold books and the total number of books is 250, the number of books sold in the first two years is 200. Therefore, 3x = 200, x = 200/3, x = 66.67. However, x must be an integer since it represents the number of books. This means that the number of books sold in the first year is 2x = 133.33, which is also not an integer. This is a contradiction. However, we know that the number of books sold in the current year is 45. Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is 2 * 45 = 90. The number of books sold in the first two years is 90 + 45 = 135. Since the total number of books sold in the first two years is 200, the number of books sold in the third year is 200 - 135 = 65. However, we know that the number of unsold books is 50. Therefore, the total number of books is 250 - 50 = 200. The number of books sold in the first two years is 200. The number of books sold in the first year is 90. The number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 90 = 110.

Multiply 49/6 by 12/1 to get 588/6. Simplify to 98. Total eaten is 98. Total pizzas is 5. Each pizza has 12 slices. Total slices is 5*12 = 60. Total eaten is 98.

After buying candy, he has $10 - $1.5x left, where x is the number of pounds of candy. He then spends half of this change on gumballs, which costs $0.05 each. Since he bought 40 gumballs, he spent 40 * $0.05 = $2 on gumballs. Half of his change is $2, so his change after buying candy is $4. This means $10 - $1.5x = $4 + $2 = $6. Solving for x, we get $1.5x = $10 - $6 = $4. Dividing both sides by $1.5, we get x = $4 / $1.5 = 2.6667. Since we can't buy a fraction of a pound, we round down to 2 pounds, but we need to check if this is the correct answer. If Billy bought 2 pounds of candy, he would have $10 - $3 = $7 left. He would then spend half of this, which is $3.5, on gumballs. Since he can't buy a fraction of a gumball, this is not the correct answer. We need to round down to 1 pound of candy.

Since there are two classes, the total number of students is 2x = 80. We know that 40% of the students in each class are girls, so 60% are boys. The number of boys in each class is 0.6x. Since there are two classes, the total number of boys is 2 * 0.6x = 1.2x. We know that the total number of boys is 80 - 40 = 40. So, 1.2x = 40. Solving for x, we get x = 40 / 1.2 = 33.33. Since x must be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a student), we round down to 33. However, this would mean that the total number of students is 66, not 80. Therefore, we round up to 34. This would mean that the total number of students is 68, which is still not 80. We need to round up to 33.33, but since we can't have a fraction of a student, we need to find the least common multiple of 1.2 and 2, which is 12.

We multiply 33.33 by 12/12 to get 40, and then divide by 2 to get 20. Then we divide 20 by 1.2 to get 16.67. We multiply 16.67 by 12/12 to get 20, and then divide by 2 to get 10. Then we divide 10 by 1.2 to get 8.33. We multiply 8.33 by 12/12 to get 10, and then divide by 2 to get 5. Then we divide 5 by 1.2 to get 4.17.

The total cost is $15 + $6 = $21. Then, calculate the total amount of money Jenny has. She has 5 * $5 = $25. Now, calculate the change. The change is $25 - $21 = $4. Since they only have quarters for change, we need to convert the change to quarters. There are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4. So, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.\",\n\"ANSWER\":16}", "3": "{\" EXPLANATION\":\"First, calculate the total cost of roses. Since 15 roses is more than a dozen, we use the price per rose. Then, calculate the change by subtracting the cost from the total amount of money. Since they only have quarters for change, divide the change by the value of a quarter (0.25) to find the number of quarters. Since 5 dollar bills are worth 25 dollars, and she has 5 of them, she has 25 dollars. The cost of 15 roses is 15 * 2 = 30 dollars. The change is 25 - 30 = -5 dollars.

The total cost is 24 + 6 = 30 dollars. The change is 25 - 30 = -5 dollars. Since she can't leave with negative dollars, we need to recalculate the change. The cost of 12 roses is 12 * 2 = 24 dollars. The cost of 3 roses is 3 * 2 = 6 dollars. The cost of 3 roses is more than a dozen, so we use the price for a dozen. The cost of 3 roses is 3 * 15 = 45 dollars.

After 4 minutes, the small pool loses 4x gallons and the big pool loses 8x gallons. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can set up the equation: 2x - 8x = 4(x - 4x). Solving for x, we get 2x - 8x = 4(-3x), which simplifies to -6x = -12x.

Since 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons. The rate of water loss for both pools is 4 gallons/minute. After 4 minutes, the small pool loses 4x gallons and the big pool loses 8x gallons. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can set up the equation: 2x - 8x = 4(x - 4x - 4). Solving for x, we get 2x - 8x = 4(-3x - 4), which simplifies to -6x = -12x - 16. Adding 16 to both sides, we get -6x + 16 = -12x. Adding 12x to both sides, we get 16 = 6x. Dividing both sides by 6, we get x = 16/6 = 8/3. However, this is still not correct. Let's try another approach. Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as x gallons. Since 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons. The rate of water loss for both pools is 4 gallons/minute.

Since 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x. The rate of water loss for both pools is 4 gallons/minute. After 4 minutes, the small pool will lose 4x gallons and the big pool will lose 8x gallons. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can set up the equation: 2x - 8x = 4x - 4x + y, where y is the amount of water in the small pool now. Simplifying the equation, we get -6x = y. Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, we can also set up the equation: 2x - 8x = 4y. Simplifying this equation, we get -6x = 4y. Equating the two expressions for -6x, we get y = y. This means that the amount of water lost by the small pool is equal to the amount of water lost by the big pool. Since the rate of water loss is the same for both pools, the amount of water lost by the small pool is 4x. Therefore, the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 4x = -3x. However, since the amount of water in the pool cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem. Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as x. Since 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x. The rate of water loss for both pools is 4 gallons/minute. After 4 minutes, the small pool will lose 4x gallons and the big pool will lose 8x gallons. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can set up the equation: 2x - 8x = 4y. Simplifying the equation, we get -6x = 4y. Dividing both sides by -4, we get 1.5x = y.

This means the pirates must have dug some holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure, and then the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 times the number of holes at the end of the first day, which is 4 * 10 = 40. Since we know the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 40, and the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 29, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11. However, this is the total number of holes dug on the fourth day, including the one they found the treasure in. Since the question asks for the number of holes dug before finding the treasure, we need to subtract 1 from this total.\", \"ANSWER\": \"10\"}", "7": "{\" EXPLANATION\": \"Let's denote the number of holes dug on the first day as H1, the second day as H2, the third day as H3, and the fourth day as H4. We know H1 = 10, H2 = 13, and H3 = 8 - 2 = 6. The total number of holes at the end of the first day is H1 = 10. By the end of the fourth day, the total number of holes is 4 times the number at the end of the first day, which is 4 * 10 = 40. We also know that the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is the sum of holes dug on each day, which is H1 + H2 + H3 + H4. So, we can write the equation: 10 + 13 + 6 + H4 = 40. Simplifying the equation, we get H4 = 40 - 29 = 11.\", \" ANSWER\": \"11\"}"}}
