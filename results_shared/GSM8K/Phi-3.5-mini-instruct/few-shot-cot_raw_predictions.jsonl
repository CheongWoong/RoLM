According to the problem, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so she has 3x + 12 cards. The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341.\nCombining like terms, we get 7x + 12 = 341.\nSubtracting 12 from both sides, we get 7x = 329.\nDividing both sides by 7, we find x = 47.\nNow, we can find the number of cards Becca has: 3x + 12 = 3*47 + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153.\nSo, Becca has 153 cards.\", \"ANSWER\": \"153\"}```"}}
